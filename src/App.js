  <h1>Welcome to FeedWorld!</h1>
  <p className="mainp-text text-center">Before we had been born, we did now no longer have a threat to decide our destiny;<br/>
we had been now no longer consulted approximately which own circle of relatives we'd be born into,<br/>
 which united states we'd be a citizen of, our language and color.<br/>
How glad may want to a creature who wakes up crying while he became born be glad on this world?<br/>
Had he already turn out to be glad?<br/>
What became the actual motive of this forgetful creature?<br/>
We do not know this, perhaps we by no means will, however we do recognise this:<br/>
-Everything can be forgotten one day!<br/>
For the primary time, I'm afraid now no longer that I do not know, however that I recognise.<br/>
And this worry led me to dream of making an unforgettable network in history.<br/>
Those who decide their very own destiny...<br/>

Imagine for a second which you very own this world.<br/>
That you may have the entirety you dream of instantly, which you are on the pinnacle of your worldly pleasures,<br/>
 and that every one humanity serves you unconditionally...<br/>
But what changed into the importance of the entirety withinside the restrained human lifestyles span?<br/>

Even whilst the give up of the arena is certain, nobody must anticipate me to combat for fast happiness expectations.<br/>
Let's be honest; We are beings built now no longer to recognise the truth, however to be deceived.<br/>

While some of us are trying to make the world more livable, some are not even aware of the difference.<br/>
Instead of changing the world, I present to you the fact of building a new world;<br/>
An endless metaverse that takes its centrality from its originality,<br/>
 whose rules are determined by the community,<br/>
 who wins as you share, shares as you win, and where there is no loser...</p>

    <h3>OUR VALUES</h3>
